## AWS setup

Install AWS CLI v2

Set up AWS keys (we should get SSO enabled...)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html

## How are we scripting that?

By:

1. Creating a branch for each student to push their updated forks to
2. Putting those branchnames into the branchnames.txt file
3. Running ```test.py```

That's it!
